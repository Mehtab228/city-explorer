# City Explorer

[My diagram](src/components/Untitled-2022-09-26-1402.png)

**Author**: Mehtab Riar
**Version**: 1.0.0 (increment the patch/fix version number if you make more commits past your first submission)

## Overview

- As a user I want to be able to input a city name and have its exact location, including its location within a country, its latitude and longitude showup. I also want to be able to see a map that is zoomed in so I can decide where I want to explore. If I input an incorrect city I want to be able to see on the page the error that is displayed.

## Getting Started

- Step 1 would be to create your react file using the command npx create-react-app 'name of your app'
- Step 2 would be to create an account on the location IQ site and get a key
- Step 3 create a .env file with the correct variable name and set it equal to your key, also add the .env to gitignore as it is sensitive information
- Step 4 create the necessary components and use the key HTTP verb "get" in a try-catch statement to retrieve data from the API
-Step 5 use the react-bootstrap documentation to bring over the components you require

## Architecture

- I used class based inheritence in REACT, NODE JS, JS, CSS, BOOTSRAP
- I used card, alert, and the basic form on bootstrap to create the necessary architecture

## Overview 2

- We added weather data to out site for the next 3 days, so if you're planning a trip the user can see what the local weather was. Although not accurate it helped us validate the EXPRESS server we created. Tomorrow we will be adding up to date information using an existing API
