# City Explorer

**Author**: Mehtab Riar
**Version**: 1.0.0 (increment the patch/fix version number if you make more commits past your first submission)

## Overview

- As a user I want to be able to input a city name and have its exact location, including its location within a country, its latitude and longitude showup. I also want to be able to see a map that is zoomed in so I can decide where I want to explore. If I input an incorrect city I want to be able to see on the page the error that is displayed.

## Getting Started

- Step 1 would be to create your react file using the command npx create-react-app 'name of your app'
- Step 2 would be to create an account on the location IQ site and get a key
- Step 3 create a .env file with the correct variable name and set it equal to your key, also add the .env to gitignore as it is sensitive information
- Step 4 create the necessary components and use the key HTTP verb "get" in a try-catch statement to retrieve data from the API
-Step 5 use the react-bootstrap documentation to bring over the components you require

## Architecture

- I used class based inheritence in REACT, NODE JS, JS, CSS, BOOTSRAP
- I used card, alert, and the basic form on bootstrap to create the necessary architecture
